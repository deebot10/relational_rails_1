### <ins>Overview</ins>

[Relational Rails](https://github.com/deebot10/relational_rails_1) is a 10-day, 2 person project, during Mod 2 of 4 for Turing School's Back End Engineering Program.

Our challenge was to build a functioning web app consisting of multiple relational databases.

Learning goals and areas of focus consisted of:

- Apply principles of flow control across multiple methods
- Incorporating databases into program manually
- Understand & implement file IO and class interaction patterns
- Practice breaking a program into logical components
- Apply Enumerable techniques in a real context
- Apply access scope and encapsulation practices for a manually built API
